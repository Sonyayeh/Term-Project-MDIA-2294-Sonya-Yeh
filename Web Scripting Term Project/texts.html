 this page has 3 elements, the header photo, large cringy paragraph, also plz
 don't judge me with how cringe I wrote the paragraph, and a slick slider at the 
 bottom of the page. And of course, having the essential elements like the header

                <p>Keep in mind, I would never write a paragraph for anyone that is outside of assignments and for family.
                    You already know how it was with my ex, the complete opposite of you. I do not like to compare people
                    but because he is so ass it's hard not to. I never imagined myself to date people again because honestly
                    it always crushes my self confidence and mental health. For some odd reason, you help me with my self esteem
                    and encouraged me to get professional help regarding my depression and everthing else. It is weird to get 
                    support from people that are not my family or friends. You were a complete stranger to me. The more I 
                    interact with you, the more I noticed how kind-hearted and messed up you are, in a good way. They say 
                    if your partner has similar personality, there will be no issues with anything. Even though we met on the 
                    most random platform, I do believe you are the right fit for me. Even though I felt like I knew you well
                    enough, I still learn so much about you everyday. I learned you having a dog personality and loves dogs,
                    especially corgis and goldens. You love arcades, and always goes crazy whenever we go crane gaming. We 
                    found out we love gaming, Nintendo and Kirby. We love it so much you turned my room into a Kirby museum.
                    My life has gotten more fun and exciting ever since you entered my life. I'd never imagine myself being 
                    this hopeful and looking forward to experience life with someone. You completely changed me, and I am 
                    grateful for that.
